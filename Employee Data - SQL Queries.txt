#WORK IN PROGRESS
#This is a basic analysis and my first attempt at a SQL project using some fictional employee data, inspired by and guided by "Hands on Data Science" on Linkedin Learning. 
#There are two tables being queried: 'employees' and 'dates'. These queries were written in the data.world environment. 
#Skills shown: EDA, Joins, Subqueries, Aggregation


#Look at range of values of start date column

SELECT min(employees.startdate), max(employees.startdate)
FROM employees


#Check how many employees started in each month per each year

SELECT month(employees.startdate), year(employees.startdate), count(1)
FROM employees
GROUP BY month(employees.startdate), year(employees.startdate)
ORDER BY 2, 1


#See how many employees started before July 1, 2008 and either left after that date or are still working
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM employees
WHERE employees.startdate <= '2008-07-01'
and (employees.enddate >= '2008-07-01'
    OR  
    employees.enddate is NULL)


#####Which department is paid the most? 

#Look at range of values of datekey column
SELECT min(dates.datekey), max(dates.datekey)
FROM employees

#We want to determine how many employees were active in each month. 
#First, get the last day of each month

SELECT DISTINCT DATE_ADD(DATE_ADD(DATE_TRUNC(dates.datekey, "month"),1,"month"), -1, "day") eomonth
FROM dates

#This query gets the unique result when you truncate each date to just the month, add one day to get the first day of the next month, then subtract one day to get the last day of the current month

#Now, use previous query as subquery and join to employees table to solve the problem

WITH `dateslist` as (
    SELECT DISTINCT DATE_ADD(DATE_ADD(DATE_TRUNC(dates.datekey, "month"),1,"month"), -1, "day") eomonth
    FROM dates)

SELECT dateslist.eomonth, count(*)
FROM employees CROSS JOIN `dateslist` as dateslist
WHERE dateslist.eomonth >= employees.startdate 
AND (dateslist.eomonth <= employees.startdate
    OR
    employees.enddate is NULL)
GROUP BY dateslist.eomonth
ORDER BY dateslist.eomonth
